Enterprise Feature Store (EFS) SDK – a lightweight, developer-friendly toolkit to interact with the Enterprise Feature Store for machine learning pipelines.

This SDK provides simple APIs to register, retrieve, and serve features from EFS for both real-time and batch inference use cases. It’s designed to help data scientists and ML engineers streamline feature workflows while adhering to MLOps best practices.

🚀 Overview

The Enterprise Feature Store (EFS) is Enterprise-grade platform for managing ML features. It standardizes feature storage, retrieval, and governance across teams, ensuring:

🔄 Consistency – same feature definitions across training and serving.

⚡ Performance – low-latency online store access for real-time predictions.

🗂️ Scalability – support for batch feature retrieval for large-scale ML workflows.

🛡️ Governance – centralized tracking of feature lineage, metadata, and access controls.

The sdk-enterprise-featurestore-efs package wraps the EFS APIs to make it easier for developers to:

Register new feature views

Retrieve historical features for training

Fetch real-time features for online serving

Integrate EFS seamlessly into ML pipelines
